# Do It: A To-do App

## About
Do It is a serverless to-do list application that manages data using the browser's localStorage.

Functionally, the application: 
- Tracks in-progress and completed tasks
- Allows the user to set a due date and priority for a given task
- Provides the option to edit and delete tasks
- Displays and sorts tasks by the following categories:
  - Inbox: All in-progress tasks sorted by priority
  - Today: Tasks due for the current date
  - Upcoming: Tasks due within the current week (7 days)
  - Completed: A history of all completed tasks and the date they were completed on
  - Projects: A collection of project specific tasks sorted by due date
  - Overdue: A collection of tasks past their due date at the top of the page
- Provides a demo button to automatically add tasks to the app for demonstration purposes
