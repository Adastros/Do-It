# Do It: A To-do App

## About
Do It is a simple to-do list web application without a backend. It logs and tracks tasks and projects in-progress and completed tasks. A demo button is provided to automatically add tasks to the app to demonstrate the functionality of the app. 

Data from the app is stored in and retrieved from the user's browser localStorage. 

This app currently only functions with chromium-based browsers such as Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge.
